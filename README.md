## Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

## Site Structure

The website has three pages. The [home page](index.html) is the default loading page, [gallery](gallery.html) and [sign up](sign-up.html) pages are all accessible primarily from the navigation menu. There is another page called [thank you](thank-you.html) that users only see when they submit a form query.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
    The fonts chosen were 'Monsterrat' for the headings and 'Ovo' for the body text. They fall back to sans-serif respectively. 
    *  'Monsterrat' was chosen for the headings to give the user an inital welcoming feel.
    *  'Ovo' is used for the body text as it goes along nicely with the headings whilst     being easy to read for all.

 * ### Colour Scheme
      The colour scheme eventually chosen is one based on gold, black and grey. The colour contrasts with the blue sky colour in many of the images. Yellow traditionally gives the impression of achievement, accomplishment and triumph. Users visiting the website should sense the feeling of extroadinary.
